A 3D Maze Game
==============

After researching a couple of different *maze generation* algorithms and writing them in Python, I thought it would be cool to incorporate them in to some JavaScript projects.

I made a [little demo page](http://joeiddon.me/3dMazeGame/maze_generation_demo) which explains and shows two of my favourite algorithms. On that page (or you can also access them directly above) are links to my original Python code that just generates the mazes and prints them to the console. If you are more versed in Python, than JS, you may wish to take a look at them, rather than the JS source.

I have also written [a post](http://joeiddon.me/projects/javascript/mazeGeneration) on my site that goes into much more depth.

However, the main focus of this project was the **3D** aspect. The aim and controls are explained on the first screen, so if you'd like to take a look, then [**visit here**](http://joeiddon.me/3dMazeGame/").
