Make the initial cell the current cell and mark it as visited
While there are unvisited cells\n	
	If the current cell has any neighbours which have not been visited
		Choose randomly one of the unvisited neighbours
		Push the current cell to the stack
		Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell
		Make the chosen cell the current cell and mark it as visited
	Else if stack is not empty
		Pop a cell from the stack
		Make it the current cell
