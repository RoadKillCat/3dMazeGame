Recursive Backtracker:

Make an initial cell the current cell and mark it as visited
While there are unvisited cells	
	If the current cell has any neighbours which have not been visited
		Choose randomly one of the unvisited neighbours
		Push the current cell to the stack
		Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell
		Make the chosen cell the current cell and mark it as visited
	Else if stack is not empty
		Pop a cell from the stack
		Make it the current cell

Prim's Algorithm:

Each cell is one of three types: 
	(1) "In": The cell is part of the Maze and has been carved into already
	(2) "Frontier": The cell is not part of the Maze and has not been carved into yet, but is next to a cell that's already "in"
	(3) "Out": The cell is not part of the Maze yet, and none of its neighbors are "in" either. 

Pick a cell
Make it "in"
Set all its neighbours to "frontier"
While there are frontier cells
	Choose a random "frontier cell"
	Remove wall between it and an adjacent "in" cell
	Set it as "in"
	Set all its neighbours which are "out" to "frontier"
